                    <!-- <p>Located on the eastern coast of India, Kolkata has a typical tropical climate. Here’s a monthly seasonal break up so you can plan your trip accordingly:

                        October-March: Starting from autumn the weather is pleasant and is a great time to visit Kolkata. Apart from the weather, this is also the time for festivals. Kolkata comes alive during Durga Puja as there are numerous pandals all over the city with beautiful idols or Goddess Durga and multiple street food stalls. This is followed by Laxmi Puja and Kali Puja.
                        
                        In winters the temperature varies somewhere between 9°C and 11°C.
