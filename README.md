# VisitMyCityKolkta
This website aims to promote The City o Joy, Kolkata as a travel destination on the international market.It is one of India’s largest cities and one of its major ports.Fashioned by the colonial British in the manner of a grand European capital—yet now set in one of the poorest and most overpopulated regions of India—Kolkata has grown into a city of sharp contrasts and contradictions. Kolkata has had to assimilate strong European influences and overcome the limitations of its colonial legacy in order to find its own unique identity.
